This project aims to build an agentic optimization extension for TCS InTwin by embedding an intelligent meta-agent framework capable of solving real-world process industry problems using a suite of optimization techniques. The high-level work can be broadly described in five pillars:
Meta-Agent Design:
Development of a central meta-agent capable of interpreting industrial problem statements (e.g., minimize energy cost, maximize throughput, reduce emissions).
The meta-agent will analyze problem type, constraints, and objectives to determine the most appropriate sub-agent (solver) to invoke.
Sub-Agent Integration:
Creation of a library of modular optimization sub-agents, each specialized in solving a class of problems.
Examples include:
NSGA-II, NSGA-III for multi-objective optimization
Constraint-based solvers for bounded environments
Job-shop, flow-shop, and in-shop scheduling agents for discrete task allocation
Heuristic solvers like GA, SA, PSO for flexible optimization under uncertainty
Problem-Solver Routing Logic:
Establishment of routing mechanisms within the meta-agent to select and deploy the best-fit solver.
Based on problem metadata, historical agent performance, and similarity matching with prior optimization scenarios.
Platform Integration with InTwin:
Ensuring seamless compatibility with InTwinâ€™s existing SaaS and microservices architecture.
Designing APIs for passing problem definitions, receiving solutions, and logging execution traces.
Incorporating feedback monitoring and re-routing in case of solver failure or sub-optimal convergence.
Validation and User Feedback Loop:
Testing the system on simulated and real industrial datasets across sectors such as power, chemicals, and manufacturing.
Incorporating a human-in-the-loop validation interface to allow engineers to tweak parameters, compare alternatives, and validate results.
Using solution quality scores and user feedback to retrain routing strategies.
The result will be a scalable, intelligent optimization engine within InTwin, capable of autonomously handling a wide array of planning, scheduling, and resource allocation challenges in the process industry.
