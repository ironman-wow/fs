Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS): Routing and Col-
lision Avoidance for OHTs
Semiconductor factories (fabs) rely heavily on Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) systems to automat-
ically move silicon wafers between processing tools. OHTs operate on an overhead rail network and carry
wafer containers (Front Opening Unified Pods — FOUPs), enabling fully automated and continuous material
handling.
However, the highly complex and dynamic environment of a fab creates significant operational challenges
for OHT systems, which can reduce throughput, increase wafer cycle time, and risk wafer damage.
Key challenges specific to OHTs include:
• Traffic congestion at intersections and shared track segments, creating bottlenecks and delays.
• Rigid, static routing, which fails to adapt to changing fab conditions such as congestion or tool avail-
ability.
• Inefficient FOUP dispatching and hot-lot prioritization, causing delays in urgent orders and starving
critical tools.
• Lack of dynamic rerouting when a track segment becomes blocked or a tool goes down.
• Collisions or near-misses at junctions or merge points, increasing risk to wafer quality and equipment.
These challenges highlight the need for intelligent, adaptive, and coordinated control of OHT systems,
improving fab efficiency, responsiveness to dynamic conditions, and operational safety.
Benefits
• Dynamic Routing: AI adapts paths in real-time to avoid congestion and blocked tracks.
• Hot-Lot Prioritization: Ensures urgent wafers move faster, reducing cycle time.
• Collision Prevention: RL minimizes near-misses at junctions for safer operations.
• Tool Starvation Avoidance: Smart dispatching keeps critical tools supplied.
• Scalability: Handles growing OHT fleets without manual tweaks.
• Cost Savings: Fewer delays, less wafer damage, and lower downtime.
Solution Approach
Develop an intelligent, adaptive control framework using reinforcement learning and predictive model-
ing to optimize routing, dispatching, and collision avoidance of OHT systems in dynamic fab environments.
