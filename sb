The cited prior art (Gowalikar et al.) describes an agentic system for generating P&ID textual representations (DEXPI XML) from natural language, which are then visualized. While it shares the concept of an agentic approach, it differs fundamentally from the claimed invention's Feature 1 in the following ways:

Scope of Generation (PFDs and PIDs) and "Industrially Viable": Gowalikar et al. focus specifically on generating P&ID diagrams. The claimed Feature 1 encompasses the generation of both PFDs and PIDs. More critically, the claimed invention aims for "industrially viable" outputs. Gowalikar et al. employ rule-based validation for flow/transitions and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for refinement, but they do not disclose the integration of first-principles simulation validation (e.g., verifying material/energy balances, thermodynamic consistency, or dynamic control performance) as described in the applicant's methodology. This simulation validation is key to achieving the "industrially viable" standard of the present invention.

Nature and Training of Language Models: Gowalikar et al. utilize a "pre-trained LLM" within their agentic workflow. The claimed Feature 1 specifies the integration of "domain-specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) trained for chemical process QA tasks (e.g., equipment selection, control logic validation)." This distinct training methodology, as detailed in the applicant's disclosure (e.g., using datasets like Factual QA, SynDIP, LogiCore), imbues the SLMs with deep, specialized reasoning capabilities for chemical engineering challenges. Gowalikar et al. do not teach or suggest such specialized SLMs or this QA-centric training approach for the core generation task; their LLM primarily executes plans derived from natural language.

Knowledge Integration and Contextual Guidance: The claimed invention's framework (as detailed in the full disclosure and independent claim 1) guides the SLM with context retrieved from a hierarchical knowledge graph specific to chemical process and instrumentation information. Gowalikar et al.'s system uses context from previously executed plan steps and the user prompt but does not describe the use of such a structured, domain-specific hierarchical knowledge graph for comprehensive contextual grounding during the generation of PFDs/PIDs.

End-to-End Agentic Framework Complexity and Integration: While Gowalikar et al. use "Plan and Execute Agents," the claimed invention's "end-to-end Agentic Framework" represents a more comprehensive system. As detailed in the applicant's methodology (Figure 3(b) and text), this includes a Meta-Agent orchestrating not only the SLM but also its interaction with memory databases, the hierarchical knowledge graph, advanced inference optimizations like Test-Time Inference Scaling (TTIS) during generation for enhanced reliability (as per claim point 2), and a Critique-Agent for iterative refinement before final output. Gowalikar et al. do not describe such an extensive, integrated framework with in-process reliability enhancements like TTIS or the specific interplay with a dedicated Critique-Agent and knowledge graph as part of the core generation loop to achieve industrially viable outputs. Their HITL is a post-generation step, and their validation is primarily rule-based.
