The plot shows strong scores in helpfulness, correctness, and coherence, indicating well-formed answers, while lower scores in complexity and verbosity suggest simpler, more concise responses.
The plot highlights strong performance in coherence, correctness, and helpfulness, while scores for complexity and verbosity are comparatively lower, indicating areas that may require further enrichment or elaboration.
The plot reveals that while coherence remains relatively strong, the rejected responses perform poorly on helpfulness, correctness, complexity, and verbosity â€” highlighting major deficiencies in both informational value and expression quality.
The scores reveal strong performance in coherence and overall informativeness, while slightly lower scores in complexity and verbosity indicate that the descriptions are well-structured but may lean toward simpler, more concise phrasing.
The plot shows high coherence and moderate complexity/verbosity, suggesting that the dataset captures logical reasoning with reasonably detailed explanations, though helpfulness and correctness could be improved for deeper instructional utility.
The figure shows strong performance in coherence, correctness, and helpfulness, indicating the effectiveness of the retrieval-augmented strategy, though lower complexity and verbosity scores suggest answers are direct but may lack elaboration.
The chart highlights strong coherence and correctness, affirming sound integration across multiple sources, while lower complexity and verbosity suggest that the responses prioritize clarity and conciseness over detailed elaboration.
