Current Capabilities of TCS InTwin:
InTwin is a mature digital twin platform built on AI, physics-based modeling, and IoT integration.
It currently enables predictive maintenance, root cause analysis, anomaly detection, and process insights across industries like manufacturing, energy, and chemicals.
Over 120 industrial AI algorithms are supported for diagnostics, monitoring, and forecasting.
Its architecture is based on modular, cloud-native microservices that support easy integration with third-party systems and sensors.
Gap in Optimization Intelligence:
While InTwin excels in reactive and predictive capabilities, it lacks built-in, intelligent, and adaptive optimization mechanisms.
Current optimizations, if any, are either manual, external to the platform, or not context-aware.
Proposal for Enhancement:
We propose integrating an agentic optimization layerâ€”powered by a meta-agent that dynamically chooses the most suitable sub-agent (solver) to tackle industrial optimization problems.
This allows InTwin not only to monitor and predict but also to autonomously optimize key operations such as scheduling, job allocation, energy consumption, and throughput balancing.
Strategic Value:
This agentic layer transforms InTwin from a diagnostic digital twin into a prescriptive and autonomous optimization engine.
By embedding real-time solvers within InTwin, the platform can now support decision-making scenarios that involve constraints, objectives, and trade-offs, delivering higher value to clients.
