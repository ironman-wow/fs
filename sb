The knowledge graph is required when the SLM needs to generate responses or PFD/PID elements that demand:

High Factual Precision: Accessing specific, verifiable details (e.g., chemical properties, equipment specs) not reliably stored in the SLM's parameters.

Complex Relational Reasoning: Understanding and navigating intricate, domain-specific connections between entities (e.g., process dependencies, control logic).

Information Provenance: Grounding outputs in identifiable source data from the curated knowledge base.

Current or Niche Domain Knowledge: Utilizing specialized or updated information beyond the SLM's general pre-training.
