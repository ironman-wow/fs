This "additional context" is not just general knowledge but targeted information precisely related to the user's query or the specific PFD/PID element being generated, pulled from the structured knowledge graph to ground the SLM's response in verified domain data, thereby enhancing accuracy and reducing reliance on potentially fallible parametric memory
The "additional context" is dynamically retrieved, query-specific structured data from the chemical knowledge graph, comprising relevant entities (e.g., chemicals, equipment), their semantic relationships, and the original source text chunks describing them, all used to ground the SLM's initial response generation.
