The cited prior art (Schulze Balhorn et al.) describes a methodology for the "autocorrection of chemical process flowsheets" using Large Language Models (LLMs). An erroneous flowsheet (as an SFILES string) is input, and the model outputs a corrected flowsheet (SFILES string). While this involves LLMs and flowsheet representations, it is fundamentally different from the claimed invention's Feature 1, which focuses on automated generation.

Primary Objective: Autocorrection vs. Generation: The core task in Schulze Balhorn et al. is to identify and correct errors in an existing flowsheet. The claimed Feature 1, in contrast, is directed towards an "end-to-end Agentic Framework that automates the generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs" for novel chemical processes. The present invention creates new PFD/PID descriptions, often from higher-level requirements or for previously unseen chemicals, whereas Schulze Balhorn et al. refine pre-existing, potentially flawed ones.

Nature of Input and Output: Schulze Balhorn et al. operate on a sequence-to-sequence translation principle where the input is a (potentially erroneous) SFILES string representing a flowsheet, and the output is a modified (corrected) SFILES string. The present invention's framework, as detailed in the disclosure, can generate PFD/PID descriptions for novel chemicals based on broader process objectives or specifications, not just correcting an existing diagram.

SLM Specialization and Training for Generation: Schulze Balhorn et al. train a T5-small model on pairs of erroneous and correct synthetic flowsheets. The claimed Feature 1 specifies "domain-specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) trained for chemical process QA tasks (e.g., equipment selection, control logic validation)." This distinct QA-based training, as detailed in the applicant's methodology (e.g., using datasets like Factual QA, SynDIP, LogiCore), is designed to equip the SLM with generative reasoning capabilities for designing processes, which is a different and broader skill set than identifying and fixing predefined error patterns in existing diagrams.

Integration of First-Principles Simulation for Industrial Viability: A critical component of the claimed Feature 1 is ensuring the generated PFDs/PIDs are "industrially viable" through the integration of "first-principles simulation validation." Schulze Balhorn et al. acknowledge that their "current approach lacks physical/engineering knowledge" and envision integrating such knowledge as future work. Their system does not incorporate in-loop simulation-based validation to ensure the engineering soundness or operational feasibility of the (corrected) flowsheets.

Agentic Framework and Orchestration: The claimed invention's Feature 1 is an "end-to-end Agentic Framework." Schulze Balhorn et al. describe a direct sequence-to-sequence model. They do not disclose a comprehensive agentic architecture involving a Meta-Agent, Critique-Agent, hierarchical knowledge graph integration for contextual generation guidance, or advanced in-process reliability enhancements like Test-Time Inference Scaling (TTIS) as detailed in the applicant's disclosure and broader claims.
