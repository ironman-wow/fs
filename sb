Defect Source Detection in Semiconductor Manufacturing Using
GenAI-Based Image and Video Analytics
The Context
Semiconductor manufacturing (fabs) involves highly precise and defect-sensitive processes such as wafer
fabrication, lithography, etching, and packaging.
• Each wafer undergoes hundreds of inspection steps, generating high-resolution images and videos.
– Inspection: “Is there anything wrong here?” — detecting visible defects or anomalies.
• These data are vital for identifying defect sources, monitoring process quality, and ensuring alignment.

• Manual and rule-based systems often fail to capture rare, subtle, or evolving defect modes and require
constant reprogramming.
• Video feeds also hold insights on operational inefficiencies, equipment anomalies, and safety violations
— but remain underutilized.
The Challenge
• Rare and novel defect sources often go undetected or misclassified, while false positives/negatives
increase scrap and rework.
• Traditional models degrade over time due to process drifts and evolving defect modes.
• Identifying root causes of observed defects across steps is complex and time-consuming.
• High-resolution image/video streams are difficult to analyze consistently and at scale.
• Video monitoring for operational anomalies remains largely manual and reactive.
Objectives
• Detect and trace defect sources, including novel and rare patterns, with high accuracy.
• Minimize false alarms, scrap, and rework while improving traceability.
• Continuously adapt to process changes and emerging failure modes.
• Automate real-time monitoring of equipment and operations for quality assurance.
• Scale analytics effectively across large, high-volume image and video datasets.
Solution Approach
Deploy a GenAI-powered image and video analytics platform to detect, trace, and explain defect sources and
operational anomalies in real time, while adapting to evolving processes and minimizing false alarms.
