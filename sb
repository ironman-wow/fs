Virtual Metrology for Quality Control in Semiconductor Manufac-
turing Using AI
The Context
Virtual Metrology (VM) is an AI-driven technique that predicts wafer measurements without physical
testing. It uses real-time process data (e.g., sensor readings, equipment parameters) and machine learning to
estimate key quality metrics (e.g., film thickness, etch depth, critical dimensions) that traditionally require
slow, costly metrology tools.
In semiconductor fabs, physical metrology ensures wafers meet specifications but is expensive, time-
consuming, and samples only a fraction of wafers. At the same time, fabs generate abundant real-time
process data that correlates with wafer quality but remains underutilized.
The Challenge
• Physical metrology introduces delays, high costs, and limited sampling.
• Undetected process drifts can lead to scrap and yield loss.
• High-dimensional, noisy process data and variability make modeling challenging, and models degrade
over time.

Objectives
• Predict wafer quality metrics directly from real-time process data, enabling 100% virtual coverage.
• Provide fast, robust, and adaptive feedback for process control and yield improvement.
• Reduce metrology costs and improve throughput without compromising quality.
Solution Approach
Deploy an AI-powered Virtual Metrology system that predicts wafer quality outcomes from process and equip-
ment data using advanced DL techniques — to model complex dependencies, adapt to drift, and deliver fast,
accurate predictions.
Benefits
• Faster feedback and timely corrective actions.
• 100% wafer monitoring, improved yield, and process stability.
• Lower metrology costs with higher confidence in quality assurance.
