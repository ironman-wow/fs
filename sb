The main challenge in adopting Generative AI in the US chemical and pharmaceutical sectors is the lack of high-quality, proprietary training data. This patent covers a new automated pipeline for creating domain-specific datasets (such as SynDIP, LogiCore, and DPO pairs) without the need for costly human annotation. By protecting this hierarchical data generation and reward-model validation approach, TCS builds a strong competitive advantage. It enables TCS to provide differentiated Data-Centric AI services, allowing us to quickly generate high-quality synthetic training data to fine-tune reliable SLMs for US clients who cannot share sensitive internal data.



In the European market, which emphasizes industrial rigor and Safe AI, standard synthetic data is often seen as unreliable. This invention defines a clear technical method for generating datasets that are not only linguistically accurate but also engineering-compliant, validated through physics-aware reward loops. By patenting this structured pipeline—where advanced reasoning tasks are built step by step from process descriptions—TCS positions itself as a provider of engineering-grade data synthesis. This capability is essential for serving European Industry 4.0 clients who need mathematically and physically consistent training data for Digital Twin and plant automation use cases.
