AI-Driven Recipe Optimization in Semiconductor Manufacturing
The Context
In semiconductor manufacturing, a recipe defines the precise process settings (e.g., gas flow, RF power,
pressure, temperature) and sequences executed by tools during wafer processing steps like etching, deposition,
or annealing.
• Recipes directly impact wafer quality, yield, and tool productivity.
• Traditionally, recipes are developed and tuned through manual, trial-and-error experimentation, which
is time-consuming and suboptimal.
• As product complexity and variability increase, efficient and adaptive recipe optimization becomes
critical for maintaining productivity and quality.
The Challenge
• Manual recipe development is slow, costly, and prone to suboptimal settings.
• Process interactions are highly complex and nonlinear, making it difficult to predict outcomes of
parameter changes.
• Finding optimal trade-offs between competing objectives (e.g., uniformity vs. throughput) is challeng-
ing.
• Variations in tools, products, and environments require frequent retuning.
Objectives
• Automatically generate optimal process recipes that achieve target wafer specifications and maximize
yield.
• Reduce recipe development time and engineering effort.
• Adapt recipes to new products, tools, and conditions efficiently.
• Balance competing objectives like wafer quality, cycle time, and throughput.

Solution Approach
Deploy an AI-driven recipe optimization platform that leverages process simulations, predictive models, and
optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning) to explore the process param-
eter space, predict outcomes, and generate optimal recipes that meet desired specifications and improve pro-
ductivity.
