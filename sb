Industrial Need: Traditional optimization in process industries is fragmented, often performed via offline tools. There's a need for embedded, real-time, and adaptive optimization inside operational digital twins.
Strategic Fit: Enhancing InTwin with agentic optimization aligns with global trends in autonomous operations, Industry 4.0, and AI-driven manufacturing.
TAM (Total Addressable Market): The global digital twin market is expected to exceed $100B by 2030, with optimization-related capabilities forming a major growth area.
Differentiation: No current commercial digital twin platform offers an embedded meta-agent for optimization routing with industry-tailored solvers.
First-Mover Advantage: This extension positions InTwin ahead of competitors by enabling real-time optimization inside the twin rather than as a post-hoc function.
