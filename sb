1. Input Processing and Orchestration
User Query Initiation: The process begins when a user submits a query.
Safety and Compliance: The query first passes through Guardrails, which enforce safety protocols and content policies.
Meta-Agent Coordination: A central Meta-Agent receives the validated query and orchestrates the entire response generation workflow.
2. Core Reasoning and Contextual Retrieval
Specialized SLM Engine: The Meta-Agent utilizes a specialized Instruction-tuned or Policy Optimized SLM as its primary reasoning engine.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): To provide factual and contextually aware responses, the SLM accesses two critical data sources:
Memory Database: Stores conversational history and short-term context.
Graph Database: A structured knowledge graph that enables the retrieval of deep, interconnected domain knowledge.
Inference Acceleration: The generation process is enhanced with a suite of performance optimizations—including FlashAttention, Paged KV Caching, Look-ahead Decoding, and Test-Time Scaling—to ensure low latency and high throughput.
3. Iterative Critique and Refinement Loop
Initial Response Generation: The system produces an initial, unvalidated response.
Critique-Agent Evaluation: This response is then assessed by a Critique-Agent, which leverages a comprehensive evaluation module composed of three distinct judges:
SLM-as-a-judge: An autonomous language model assesses the response for logical coherence, style, and fluency.
Reward Model-as-a-judge: A specialized model scores the output against predefined quality metrics (e.g., correctness, helpfulness).
Human-as-a-judge: Provides human oversight and evaluation for the most critical or nuanced assessments.
Feedback Integration: The collective judgment is synthesized into actionable Feedback, which is looped back to the Meta-Agent. This allows the system to iteratively refine and improve the response before finalizing it.
4. Final Output Delivery
After passing the rigorous critique and refinement cycle, the final, validated Output is delivered to the user, ensuring a high standard of accuracy and reliability.
