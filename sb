Background of the Invention

The present invention relates to methods for generating synthetic datasets, and more specifically, to the generation of structured and specialized datasets for training machine learning models, particularly language models, in the domain of chemical process engineering schematics such as Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (PIDs).

Effective training of sophisticated machine learning models capable of understanding, interpreting, and generating PFDs and PIDs is critically dependent on the availability of large-scale, high-quality, and appropriately structured training data. However, the chemical process industry faces significant challenges regarding the accessibility and suitability of existing data for these purposes.

One major limitation is the proprietary and confidential nature of most industrial PFDs and PIDs. These diagrams contain sensitive intellectual property related to process designs, operational know-how, and competitive advantages. Consequently, vast repositories of real-world, detailed engineering schematics are not publicly available or easily shareable for training machine learning models, severely restricting the volume and diversity of accessible data.

Furthermore, even when some PFDs or PIDs are found in publicly accessible literature, such as textbooks, academic papers, or older patents, they often suffer from several shortcomings. These publicly available diagrams may be incomplete, simplified, or abstracted for illustrative purposes, lacking the intricate detail, comprehensive annotations, and specific operational context crucial for robust model training. They may not consistently adhere to modern industry standards or reflect the complexity of contemporary industrial processes.

Another challenge is the lack of structured, machine-readable formats for existing diagrams. Many PFDs and PIDs exist primarily as image files (e.g., scanned PDFs, CAD drawings in non-interoperable formats) or embedded figures within documents. Extracting and converting this visual information into a structured format suitable for training language models – one that captures not only the graphical elements but also the underlying semantic relationships, process logic, and instrumentation details – is a technically complex, error-prone, and labor-intensive task. This makes large-scale ingestion and processing of such data prohibitively expensive and inefficient.

Additionally, there is a scarcity of existing datasets that are specifically curated to teach distinct, yet complementary, cognitive skills required for deep PFD/PID understanding. For instance, datasets that isolate foundational factual knowledge about chemical engineering principles are rare, as are datasets that provide paired preferred and dispreferred examples of diagram interpretations or generation for preference alignment. Similarly, there is a lack of datasets explicitly designed to train models on multi-step logical reasoning specific to process design choices and control strategies depicted in PFDs/PIDs, or datasets structured for retrieval-augmented learning where diagram elements are explained in the context of specific source documentation.

The heterogeneity in diagrammatic styles, notations (even within standards), and levels of detail across different companies, projects, and eras further complicates the creation of a unified, high-quality training corpus from existing scattered sources. This inconsistency and lack of standardization in available data make it difficult for models to generalize well.

Therefore, there exists a pressing need for novel methods to systematically generate high-quality, structured, and diverse synthetic datasets that can overcome these limitations of existing data availability. Such synthetic datasets are essential for effectively training machine learning models to achieve proficiency in the complex domain of chemical process engineering schematics, thereby enabling advancements in automated design, analysis, and interpretation of PFDs and PIDs.
