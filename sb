Project Origin: Emerged from gaps observed in batch and continuous process industries where optimization is traditionally done offline or manually.
Contextual Relevance: Designed for sectors such as chemicals, petrochemicals, power, and manufacturing, where real-time scheduling, job allocation, and constrained resource planning are critical.
Research Basis: Built on proven optimization techniques like NSGA-II/III, flow shop and job shop scheduling, and metaheuristics like GA, SA, PSO.
Integration Scope: Will be embedded into InTwin as a modular optimization layerâ€”compatible with its SaaS architecture and microservices interfaces.
Long-term Vision: Move towards fully autonomous digital twins that not only monitor and predict but also optimize operations with minimal human intervention.
