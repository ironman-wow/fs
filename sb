The cited prior art (Hirtreiter et al.) differs significantly from the claimed invention's Feature 1 in several key aspects:

Framework Architecture and Orchestration: Hirtreiter et al. describe a direct sequence-to-sequence model for translating PFDs to PFDs with control structures using SFILES 2.0 notation. This contrasts with the claimed invention's "end-to-end Agentic Framework," which involves a more sophisticated system architecture with distinct, coordinating agents (e.g., a Meta-Agent orchestrating SLM invocation, context retrieval, and interaction with a Critique-Agent as detailed in the applicant's methodology and broader claims). Hirtreiter et al. do not disclose such an agentic framework.

Scope and Nature of Generation for "Industrially Viable" Outputs: Hirtreiter et al. focus on adding control structures to pre-existing PFDs, effectively translating one PFD representation to another with added control information. The claimed invention's Feature 1 describes a system that "automates the generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs" more broadly, implying the capability to generate these diagrams for novel chemical processes potentially from higher-level specifications, and critically, ensures their industrial viability.

SLM Specialization and Training Methodology: While Hirtreiter et al. use a transformer model trained on PFD data, the claimed invention's Feature 1 specifies "domain-specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) trained for chemical process QA tasks (e.g., equipment selection, control logic validation)." This QA-based training approach, designed to imbue the SLM with deeper reasoning capabilities about chemical processes (as detailed in the applicant's methodology with datasets like Factual QA, SynDIP, and LogiCore), is distinct from Hirtreiter et al.'s SFILES-based translation task training. Hirtreiter et al. do not teach or suggest SLMs trained on such diverse QA tasks for PFD/PID generation.

Integrated Validation for Industrial Viability: A crucial aspect of the claimed Feature 1 is the integration of "first-principles simulation validation" to ensure the generation of "industrially viable" diagrams. Hirtreiter et al. mention "validity checks" as a potential future work but do not describe or incorporate an integrated first-principles simulation step (e.g., using simulators like DWSIM to verify material/energy balances, thermodynamic consistency, or control loop performance) as a core, in-loop component of their methodology. The claimed invention explicitly uses this to ensure the practical engineering feasibility of the generated schematics.
