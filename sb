Context retrieval from the knowledge graph in the Graph RAG framework is executed precisely as follows:

The input query is embedded into a vector.

This vector is used to identify and retrieve the top-K most semantically similar, pre-clustered communities within the knowledge graph by comparing against their embedded summaries.

A dynamic subgraph is then constructed from these top-K communities, containing only the most query-relevant entities, their defined semantic relationships, and their linked source text chunks.

This extracted, structured subgraph serves as the precise "additional context" provided to the SLM.
