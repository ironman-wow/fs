The SLM doesn't ask for a specific amount of context. The Graph RAG retrieval process determines the quantity and content of the context based on its configuration (e.g., top-K parameter, subgraph construction logic) and the constraints of the SLM's input window. The SLM is then trained to make the best use of whatever relevant (or less relevant) context it is given by the retrieval system.
