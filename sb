Slide 2 â€“ Semiconductor Manufacturing Background

Semiconductor manufacturing involves hundreds of steps such as deposition, etching, and doping, each of which must be precisely controlled.

Every step is guided by a recipe, which specifies parameters such as wafer chuck temperature, chamber pressure, gas flow rates, plasma power, and process time.

Even small variations in recipe parameters can lead to large changes in wafer quality, yield, and device performance.

Slide 3 â€“ What is a Recipe?

A recipe is a digital instruction file that tells the process equipment exactly how to carry out a step in semiconductor fabrication.

For example, a plasma etching recipe might specify a chuck temperature of 60 Â°C, a chamber pressure of 20 mTorr, argon and CFâ‚„ gas flows of 50 and 30 sccm, and an RF power of 200 W for a fixed time.

These recipe instructions directly control material removal or deposition and therefore determine outcomes such as film thickness, uniformity, stress, and defect formation.

Slide 4 â€“ Why Optimize Recipes?

Traditional recipe optimization relies on trial-and-error experiments, which are slow and can take weeks or months to stabilize a single process.

This approach is also expensive, since wafers, gases, and energy are consumed during experimental runs, much of which ends up wasted.

As device dimensions shrink, recipes involve more interdependent parameters, which makes manual optimization impractical and motivates the need for automated, physics-aware methods.

Slide 5 â€“ Physics Behind Recipe Steps

Wafer processing involves thermal physics, which governs heat conduction in the wafer and chamber walls.

Chemical vapor deposition controls how gas species are transported and react on the wafer surface to form solid films.

Plasma etching removes material through a combination of ion bombardment and surface chemistry.

Thin films generate mechanical stress, which can lead to warping or cracking of the wafer.

Dopants diffuse within the wafer and defects form or heal during thermal cycles.

Electrical properties depend on charge carrier transport, which is influenced by all the other physics.

Slide 6 â€“ Mathematical Model

Heat transfer is described by the heat equation, which models how temperature changes with conduction and heating sources.

Mass transport and chemical reactions are modeled with diffusionâ€“reaction equations that describe how gas species spread and react.

Film growth or etching is represented by a thickness evolution equation that depends on gas concentration and temperature.

Stress is modeled by mechanical equilibrium equations that balance forces within thin films.

Dopant diffusion follows Fickâ€™s law with concentration-dependent diffusivity.

Electrical transport is described by driftâ€“diffusion equations for electrons and holes under electric fields.

Slide 7 â€“ Why Traditional Simulation Struggles

The equations describing these processes are highly nonlinear and tightly coupled, which makes them computationally expensive to solve.

Some processes involve moving boundaries, such as changing film thickness, which adds further complexity.

Recipe optimization involves exploring a high-dimensional space of parameters such as temperature, pressure, gas composition, and plasma power.

Classical numerical solvers can take hours or days to simulate one recipe, which is too slow for practical optimization in semiconductor fabs.

Slide 8 â€“ Parameterized XPINN (pXPINN)

An Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) is a neural model trained to satisfy both physics equations and available data, ensuring its predictions are physically consistent.

A parameterized XPINN (pXPINN) goes further by including recipe parameters such as chuck temperature, chamber pressure, and gas flows directly as inputs to the network.

This allows a single trained model to cover an entire family of recipes, rather than needing a separate model for each set of conditions.

The modular structure couples specialist networks (thermal, CVD, stress, etc.), with outputs from one physics block feeding into the next to preserve dependencies.

The result is a generalizable model that predicts wafer outcomes under new recipe settings with high accuracy.

Slide 9 â€“ Workflow with pXPINN and PINO

First, the ranges of recipe parameters such as temperature, pressure, and gas flows are defined for the process of interest.

The pXPINN is trained on both physics equations and sparse wafer data, taking coordinates and recipe parameters as inputs and predicting outputs such as temperature, film thickness, and stress.

Once trained, the pXPINN can generate a large dataset of wafer outcomes across the recipe space.

A Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) is then trained on this dataset to act as a fast surrogate model that runs in milliseconds.

Optimization algorithms use the PINO to search for recipes that maximize objectives like uniformity and minimize issues such as defects, while respecting safety and equipment constraints.

Slide 10 â€“ Advantages of the Parameterized XPINN Approach

Because the model includes physics equations in its training, its predictions are physically consistent even when experimental data are limited.

By including recipe parameters as inputs, the pXPINN can generalize across a wide range of recipes with a single network.

The modular design means that new physics modules, such as defect dynamics or plasma charging, can be added without redesigning the entire model.

The direct mapping from recipe settings to wafer outcomes allows engineers to understand how recipe choices influence performance.

Slide 11 â€“ Benefits of Automated Recipe Optimization

Automated optimization reduces development time, shortening recipe tuning from several weeks to just a few days.

It lowers costs by minimizing wasted wafers and reducing the consumption of process gases and energy.

It improves manufacturing yield by producing wafers with more uniform films, lower stress, and fewer defects.

The approach scales across multiple process modules, so it can be applied to deposition, etching, doping, and beyond.

It is also more sustainable, since it reduces the overall environmental footprint of semiconductor fabrication.

Slide 12 â€“ Conclusion and Future Work

Recipe optimization is a critical challenge in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, where traditional trial-and-error methods are too slow and costly.

Parameterized XPINNs combined with PINO surrogates provide a powerful, physics-informed machine learning framework for solving this challenge.

This approach enables faster process development, lower costs, higher yields, and more sustainable production.

Future work will focus on extending the method to include additional physics such as electromagnetics and plasma charging, and integrating it into closed-loop fab control systems.

Ultimately, this framework transforms recipe optimization into a science-driven, AI-accelerated process that supports next-generation semiconductor devices.
