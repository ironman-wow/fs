The cited prior art (Qibin et al.) describes a methodology for enabling natural language communication with existing Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) by representing them as knowledge graphs and using these for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs). This work is fundamentally different from the claimed invention's Feature 1, which is directed towards the automated generation of PFDs and PIDs.

Primary Objective: Interpretation vs. Generation: Qibin et al.'s core objective is to allow users to "talk to" or query existing P&IDs ("intuitive information retrieval and analysis in P&IDs"). Their system takes an existing P&ID (in DEXPI format) as input, converts it to a knowledge graph, and uses this graph to provide context to an LLM for answering user questions about that P&ID. In contrast, the claimed Feature 1 describes an "end-to-end Agentic Framework that automates the generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs." The present invention creates new PFD/PID descriptions, whereas Qibin et al. analyze pre-existing ones.

Role of Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: In Qibin et al., the LLM and knowledge graph serve as tools for information retrieval and interpretation from a static, existing P&ID. In the claimed invention, the domain-specialized Small Language Models (SLMs), guided by context from a hierarchical knowledge graph (as detailed in the applicant's methodology and claim 1), are actively involved in the generative process of creating the PFD/PID descriptions themselves. The knowledge graph in the present invention is not just for querying but also for providing structured, domain-specific knowledge to guide the SLM's generation.

Generation of "Industrially Viable" Outputs and Validation: The claimed Feature 1 emphasizes the generation of "industrially viable" PFDs and PIDs, achieved through mechanisms including "first-principles simulation validation." Qibin et al.'s work does not involve any generation of new PFDs/PIDs, let alone their validation for industrial viability through simulation. Their focus is on the accuracy of information retrieval from existing diagrams and mitigating LLM hallucinations in that context.

Agentic Framework and SLM Specialization: The claimed invention's Feature 1 specifies an "end-to-end Agentic Framework" and "domain-specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) trained for chemical process QA tasks (e.g., equipment selection, control logic validation)." Qibin et al. use an LLM agent for retrieval and interaction but do not describe a generative agentic framework as architected by the applicant (with Meta-Agent, Critique-Agent, TTIS, etc.). Furthermore, their LLM is not described as being specifically trained on diverse chemical process QA tasks for the purpose of generating PFDs/PIDs.
