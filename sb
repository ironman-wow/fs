Scheduling and Dispatching in Semiconductor Fabs
The Context
A semiconductor factory (fab) produces chips by processing silicon wafers through hundreds of precise
manufacturing steps.
• Wafers move in batches, called lots, with each lot containing multiple wafers.
• After each processing step, lots wait in queues before moving to the next step. This waiting inventory is
called Work-In-Process (WIP).
• Lots must share expensive, specialized machines (such as lithography and etching tools), which typically
handle only one lot at a time.
• Some lots, known as hot lots, are high-priority due to customer deadlines or critical orders.
• The fab environment is dynamic: machines can fail, hot lots can arrive unexpectedly, and queues can grow
unpredictably.
The Challenge
Deciding which lot to send to which machine and when is known as scheduling and dispatching. Poor
decisions can lead to:
• Long waiting times for lots, increasing cycle time.
• Idle machines, wasting costly resources.
• Hot lots missing their deadlines.
• Bottlenecks and congestion at certain machines.
Objectives
The main goals of effective scheduling and dispatching are:
• Minimize total waiting and processing time for lots.
• Maximize machine utilization and productivity.
• Ensure high-priority (hot) lots are completed on time.
• Adapt schedules quickly to real-time changes, such as equipment failures or rush orders.
Benefits
Achieving these objectives provides significant benefits:
• Faster delivery of critical orders.
• Higher factory throughput and efficiency.
• Greater flexibility and resilience in operations.
Solution Approach
Use reinforcement learning, machine learning, and optimization algorithms to build an adaptive scheduling
and dispatching system that prioritizes hot lots, balances machine utilization, and dynamically responds to
real-time fab conditions to minimize cycle time and maximize efficiency.
