The main challenge in adopting Generative AI in the US chemical and pharmaceutical sectors is the lack of high-quality, proprietary training data. This patent covers a new automated pipeline for creating domain-specific datasets (such as SynDIP, LogiCore, and DPO pairs) without the need for costly human annotation. By protecting this hierarchical data generation and reward-model validation approach, TCS builds a strong competitive advantage. It enables TCS to provide differentiated Data-Centric AI services, allowing us to quickly generate high-quality synthetic training data to fine-tune reliable SLMs for US clients who cannot share sensitive internal data.
