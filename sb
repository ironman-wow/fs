The prior art (Sakhinana et al.) proposes a multi-agent RAG framework using small multimodal models for understanding existing PFD/P&ID schematics to answer open-domain questions (ODQA). While they may use some synthetic data for fine-tuning their agents for QA or tool use, their primary goal is question-answering over existing visual/textual diagrams.

Our invention is fundamentally different in its objective and the nature of the synthetic datasets generated:

Goal: PFD/PID Generation, Not Just QA on Existing Diagrams: Our core objective is to generate diverse synthetic datasets to train SLMs to analyze chemical processes and, crucially, generate novel PFD and PID descriptions. This generative capability for schematics themselves is distinct from Sakhinana et al.'s focus on answering questions about pre-existing diagrams.

Comprehensive Suite of Datasets for Generation Skills: We generate a specific suite of six textual dataset types (Factual QA, DPO, SynDIP, LogiCore, Local & Global RAIT) tailored for the multifaceted task of PFD/PID generation and analysis. This includes SynDIP, which provides complete textual PFD/PID descriptions and process context as a target for generation, a dataset type not central to a QA system.

Textual Generation Focus: Our patented pipeline creates textual datasets to train SLMs for generating PFD/PID textual descriptions. Sakhinana et al. emphasize multimodal models for interpreting visual and textual components of existing diagrams for VQA and ODQA."

For Feature 2 (Extracting multiple contexts from domain in the form of QA dataset, logical and multi-scale response generation, PID and PFD generation for chemical industry):

"Sakhinana et al. describe a multi-agent RAG system that retrieves information from parsed documents and uses critique agents for refining answers in an ODQA context. Their system processes existing PFDs/P&IDs to answer questions.

Our invention's approach to context and response generation is tailored for the generation of PFDs/PIDs, not just answering questions about them:

Hierarchical Dataset Dependency for Generation Training (SynDIP Centrality): A key inventive step in our work is using our synthetically generated SynDIP dataset (textual PFD/PID descriptions and process context) as the primary input document/context for creating other specialized instructional datasets like LogiCore (multi-step reasoning about the design choices in the SynDIP content) and RAIT (retrieval-augmented responses grounded in SynDIP content). This hierarchical generation of training data, where one synthetic output becomes the learning basis for another, is not described by Sakhinana et al.'s QA-focused RAG.

Contexts and Reasoning Geared Towards Design & Generation:

Our LogiCore datasets train SLMs to generate explicit reasoning chains for PFD/PID design choices, control logic, and flow sequencing â€“ a deeper level of understanding required for generation.

Our SynDIP dataset itself represents the target output (textual PFD/PID descriptions) for the SLM to learn to generate.
This is distinct from extracting passages or generating summaries to answer questions about an existing diagram, as in Sakhinana et al.

Ultimate Output: Generated PFD/PID Schematics: The diverse contexts, QA, reasoning, and RAIT datasets are all part of a pipeline to enable an SLM to generate PFD and PID textual descriptions. Sakhinana et al.'s system outputs answers to questions.
