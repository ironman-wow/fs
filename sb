Challenges:
Dynamically identifying the right optimization solver for different industrial problems.
Incorporating constraints, domain heuristics, and multiple conflicting objectives.
Integrating with real-time data streams from IoT sensors and enterprise systems.
Ensuring explainability and traceability of optimization outcomes in safety-critical environments.
Core Ideas:
Use of a meta-agent layer to route problems to the most suitable optimization solver.
Modular sub-agents for specialized optimization contexts (scheduling, energy use, emissions control).
Feedback-driven learning and agent selection based on past problem similarity and performance.
Visualization dashboards for engineers to interact with and validate optimization results.
