Slide 1/6: Thermal Dynamics
(Image: A simple cross-section of a wafer on a chuck with arrows indicating heat flow from the chuck and a heat source (Q) from above.)

Title: Thermal Dynamics: The Foundation of Everything

Goal: To precisely control and predict the temperature across the entire wafer at every moment in time. Temperature is the single most critical variable, influencing every other process.

Physics Model: We solve the Heat Equation, a fundamental law of physics describing how heat flows and distributes.

∂T/∂t = α∇²T + Q/ρcₚ
(Rate of Temp. Change) = (Heat Conduction) + (Heat Sources)

Key Parameters & Controls:

T_chuck (Chuck Temperature): Sets the baseline temperature from below.

P_rf (RF Power): Represents the primary heat source (Q) from plasma or lamps above.

Time: How long the wafer is heated.

Role in the System: This model is the universal foundation. Its output, the Temperature (T) field, is a critical input for every other physics module.

Slide 2/6: Dopant Diffusion
(Image: A zoom-in on the wafer cross-section. Show dots (dopant atoms) at the surface at t=0, and then an arrow showing them spread out (diffusing) into the wafer bulk over time to form a concentration gradient.)

Title: Dopant Diffusion: Creating the Electrical DNA

Goal: To introduce impurity atoms (dopants) into the silicon crystal to create P-type (positive) and N-type (negative) regions. These regions form the fundamental building blocks of transistors.

Physics Model: We use the Diffusion Equation to model how these dopant atoms spread out within the wafer when heated.

∂C/∂t = ∇·(D_eff∇C)
(Rate of Conc. Change) = (Divergence of Dopant Flux)

Key Parameters & Controls:

Dopant Source Concentration: The amount of dopant available at the surface.

Temperature (T) (from Thermal Model): This is the "accelerator." A higher temperature dramatically increases the Effective Diffusivity (D_eff), making dopants spread faster and deeper.

Role in the System: This model defines the electrical structure of the device. Its output, the Dopant Profile (C), is the essential input for the Electrical Characterization model.

Slide 3/6: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
(Image: A diagram showing gas molecules (e.g., SiH₄, NH₃) flowing over the wafer. Some molecules are shown sticking to the surface and reacting, leaving behind a solid atom and forming a new thin layer.)

Title: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD): Building the Structure Layer by Layer

Goal: To grow new, ultra-thin layers of material (like insulators or conductors) on top of the wafer with precise thickness and high uniformity.

Physics Model: We model the complex surface chemistry using Surface Reaction ODEs, which balance the rate of atoms arriving, leaving, and reacting.

dh/dt ∝ k_react(T) * θ
(Film Growth Rate) ∝ (Reaction Rate) * (Surface Coverage)

Key Parameters & Controls:

Inlet Concentration (Gas Flow): The supply of the "building block" molecules.

Temperature (T) (from Thermal Model): Critically controls the Arrhenius Reaction Rate (k_react). Higher temperatures mean faster film growth.

Role in the System: This model builds the physical layers of the device. Its output, the Film Thickness (h), is a key input for the Stress Model.

Slide 4/6: Plasma Etching
(Image: A cross-section of a wafer with a patterned "mask" on top. Show energetic ions (+) from a plasma cloud bombarding the surface and removing material only in the unmasked areas, creating a trench.)

Title: Plasma Etching: Sculpting the Nanoscale Circuits

Goal: To precisely remove material according to a pre-defined pattern (the mask), effectively "carving" the circuit features like transistor gates into the layers we deposited.

Physics Model: We use the Level Set Method, a powerful mathematical technique for tracking moving interfaces, to simulate the etch front as it moves down into the material.

∂φ/∂t + R_etch|∇φ| = 0
(Interface Speed) + (Etch Rate) * (Geometry Term) = 0

Key Parameters & Controls:

P_rf (RF Power): Controls the ion energy and density, which is the main driver of the Etch Rate (R_etch).

Gas Chemistry: Determines the chemical reactivity of the etch.

Role in the System: This model defines the lateral shape and critical dimensions of the final device features.

Slide 5/6: Mechanical Stress
(Image: A cross-section of the final wafer with multiple thin film layers. Use arrows to show one layer "pulling" (tensile stress) and another "pushing" (compressive stress) on its neighbors. The whole wafer is shown slightly bent.)

Title: Mechanical Stress: The Unavoidable Consequence

Goal: To predict the mechanical stress that builds up in the wafer. This is not a manufacturing step, but a critical result of all previous steps. Too much stress can crack the wafer or degrade device performance.

Physics Model: We solve for Mechanical Equilibrium and calculate the stress, with a major component being the Thermal Stress caused by heating and cooling.

σ_thermal ∝ E * ΔT
(Thermal Stress) ∝ (Material Stiffness) * (Change in Temperature)

Key Parameters & Controls:

Stress is not controlled directly. It's an emergent property of the entire recipe.

Role in the System: This model acts as a critical constraint checker. It takes the Temperature (T) from the Thermal Model and the Film Thickness (h) from the CVD Model to predict the final stress state, a key metric for device reliability.

Slide 6/6: Electrical Characterization
(Image: A simple diagram of a finished transistor. Show the dopant profile in the background and arrows indicating the flow of electrons from source to drain, being controlled by the gate.)

Title: Electrical Characterization: The Final Performance

Goal: To predict the ultimate electrical performance of the transistor we've built. This is the final exam for our recipe—does it produce a fast, efficient, and reliable device?

Physics Model: We solve the Drift-Diffusion Equations, which describe how charge carriers (electrons n and holes p) move under the influence of electric fields and concentration gradients.

J_n = qμₙnE + qDₙ∇n
(Current) = (Drift due to E-Field) + (Diffusion due to Gradients)

Key Parameters & Controls:

The final electrical performance is the ultimate result of all previous steps.

Role in the System: This is the final performance predictor. It takes the Dopant Profile (C) as its most critical input to calculate the final device metrics like sheet resistance and carrier mobility, which determine the chip's speed and power consumption.
