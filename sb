TCS InTwin is a robust, AI-powered digital twin platform used across various industrial domains for predictive maintenance, diagnostics, and operations optimization.
While it supports over 120 algorithms for condition monitoring and anomaly detection, there is a growing need to integrate deeper, goal-driven optimization strategies.
Our proposed enhancement introduces an agentic module that embeds optimization intelligence into InTwin, enabling it to solve complex scheduling and resource allocation problems dynamically.
This proposal outlines the framework, components, stakeholders, and strategic opportunity behind this transformative capability.
