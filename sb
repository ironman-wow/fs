AI-Driven Predictive Process Control and Maintenance in Semi-
conductor Manufacturing
The Context
Semiconductor manufacturing requires tightly controlled processes and high equipment uptime to ensure
wafer quality, yield, and productivity.
• Equipment parameters like gas flow, temperature, and pressure must be optimized in real time to
maintain process stability and avoid deviations.
• Equipment failures (e.g., in pumps, valves, robots) can cause unexpected downtime, scrap, and yield
loss.
• Modern fabs collect rich sensor and operational data that can enable AI-driven predictions and proac-
tive interventions.
The Challenge
• Process parameters can drift due to wear, contamination, or environmental changes, degrading wafer
quality and yield.
• Traditional process control is reactive and struggles to adjust to dynamic variations quickly.
• Equipment failures are often detected too late, leading to unplanned downtime, costly repairs, and
production losses.
• Manual monitoring of large volumes of sensor data is infeasible and error-prone.
Objectives
• Predict wafer measurements and adjust process parameters dynamically to maintain stability and
maximize yield.
• Detect early signs of equipment degradation and schedule maintenance proactively before failures occur.
• Improve process consistency, reduce scrap, and enhance equipment availability.
• Leverage existing sensor and operational data streams effectively.

Solution Approach
Deploy AI-driven predictive process control and predictive maintenance systems that use machine learning
models (e.g., regression, deep learning, anomaly detection) to analyze real-time sensor and equipment data,
optimize process parameters dynamically, and identify early signs of equipment failure for planned mainte-
nance.
Benefits
• Improved wafer quality and maximized yield through dynamic process optimization.
• Reduced process deviation and scrap rates.
• Increased equipment uptime and reduced unplanned maintenance costs.
• Higher productivity and more stable operations.
