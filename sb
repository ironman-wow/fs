The US market is aggressively adopting autonomous "Agentic AI" systems. This patent secures the rights to the Closed-Loop, Physics-Aware Agentic Framework that orchestrates SLMs for complex engineering tasks. Specifically, it protects the Meta-Agent architecture that utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for dynamic task decomposition and the Test-Time Inference Scaling mechanisms (Self-Consistency, Lookahead Decoding) that ensure reliability. Owning this IP allows TCS to market a robust, low-latency Enterprise SaaS solution that outperforms standard RAG systems, providing a competitive edge in selling autonomous plant design tools to US industrial clients.


This invention provides a concrete technical solution to the problem of "hallucinations" in industrial AI by integrating Simulator-in-the-Loop validation (DWSIM) and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG). Patenting this architecture—specifically the Critique-Agent feedback loops and hierarchical knowledge graph retrieval—enables TCS to offer auditable, physics-compliant AI. This is essential for the European market, where Industry 4.0 regulations demand that AI-generated PFDs/PIDs be verifiable against engineering constraints rather than just statistically probable text.
